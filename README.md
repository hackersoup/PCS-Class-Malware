## Project Layout

### PCS-Malware

Main class files dealing with the running of the malware.
This module is responsible for orchestrating the use of the
various other modules to create a cohesive piece of malware.

### Keylogger

A simple userland-based hooking keylogger which reads user keystrokes
to a provided file.

### Macros

Various assistance macros for the project. Provided a DEBUG_PRINT macro
which should be compiled out of the final release when the debug def
is unset.

Also provides a macro to encrypt strings at compile time and decrypt
strings at runtime to allow for nearly transparent obfuscation of
the strings in the file.
